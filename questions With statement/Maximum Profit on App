//You have made a smartphone app and want to set its subscription price such that the profit earned is maximised. There are certain users 
//who will subscribe to your app only if their budget is greater than or equal to your price.
//You will be provided with a list of size N having budgets of subscribers and you need to return the maximum profit that you can earn.
//Lets say you decide that price of your app is Rs. x and there are N number of subscribers. So maximum profit you can earn is :
// m * x
//where m is total number of subscribers whose budget is greater than or equal to x.

//sample input 30 20 53 14
//output 60
